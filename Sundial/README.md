I wanted to focus on the conceptual aspect of this assignment and create a simple sundial that incorporated an element of culture or the conceptual ideas of time especially since this is the first assignment and in this class, I really wanted to explore concepts of time through a different lens from what Iâ€™m used to. 
</br>

I grew up speaking Arabic with my parents and family and while I can read and write pretty well, I never really knew how to read Arabic numbers ().  </br> 
Initially, I thought that a sundial can follow the template of a clock and so I used a white/clear acrylic to cut and engrave a circular clock. </br> 
After doing a bunch of the readings and familiarizing myself a little more with the concept of a sundial, I realized that a lot of math went into making one (I realize how dumb I sound writing this). And so I remade it using the calculator adjusting some of the design elements and the numbers to match my original idea. I also did use a clear acrylic which made me kind of worried about its ability to cast a shadow but I used a darker acrylic for the Gnomon which made the shadow appear.
