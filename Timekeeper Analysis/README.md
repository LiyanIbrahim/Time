 For this blog post, I decided to analyze Mr. Jones Watches, “The Accurate”. I was especially intrigued by this relative to our reading about time and death. It initially reads as presenting an artistic and philosophical approach to timekeeping.  The hands of the watch are shaped like skeleton arms, with the words "Remember You Will Die" inscribed across the dial which acts as a reminder of mortality and in a way, that we are “running out of time”.  The rest of the watch details are very very simplistic and minimalist, with very neutral colors except for the last watch hand. It feels as if the designer wanted the viewer's emphasis to be on the hands since two have the words "Remember You Will Die" on them and the third is of a brighter orange color which heavily contrasts with the colors of the watch.  </br> </br>
 
The designer also opted out of numbering the watch and sticking to segments. This lack of traditional indices as a way to tell the time which, to me, further proves the need to emphasize the hands. This is further proved by the lack of technical complications. </br> </br>
The minimalist/strong message of the watch acts as a personal reflection device, encouraging the wearer to think about the passage of time and their own life in a profound way. It merges the utility of a timekeeper with existential thought, creating a fusion of function and philosophy.
