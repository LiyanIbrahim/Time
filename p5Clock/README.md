For this week, since we are leading the discussion and we were reading and heavily thinking about Moore’s law and singularity, we were thinking about the Y2K bug and the impacts people thought this computational error would have on computer systems. I decided to try and use that as artistic and functional inspiration to one of the code examples.
The code displays the clock but I implemented the following features on them: </br> </br>  
  
<b> Glitch Effect:</b> to  visually symbolize the Y2K bug's disruption</br> 
<b> Year Display:</b> in the event that the date is set to 1999, then there will be a visual display of  "99" flipping to "00". </br> 
<b> Color Distortion:</b> Introduce color shifts and broken hands during the "glitch," reflecting the bug’s chaotic “effects” </br> 
<b> Time Freeze/Reset:</b> Occasionally reset or freeze the time randomly for a few seconds to simulate software confusion or crashes</br>
